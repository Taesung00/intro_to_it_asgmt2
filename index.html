	  		<h6>How this information is helpful</h6>
	  		<p>Although other traits differ, one personality aspect that the team share is that we take and believe information more from the internal world, apparent by the Intuitive trait in the Myers-Briggs test.<br>Secondly, our team learns most effectively through Tactile and Visual. <br>Thanks to this common ground, it’s easier for teammates to communicate and share ideas. As we share the same effective methods of learning, we can utilize this knowledge to better get our knowledge across.<br>Furthermore, our teammates' differences complement each-others. Our team consists of both Introvert and Extrovert, Feelings and Thinkings, as well as Perception and Judging traits. Although issues might arise due to these differences, thanks to our common grounds and focus on communication, we can still collaborate well and utilize our differences to help each-other.
